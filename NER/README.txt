1) The file ner.py contains the code for named entity recognition
2) The file tsne.py contains the code for tsne projection
3) The pickle files are the output of Problems 1,2, and 3 and are input to both the codes
4) train,val and test files are input to the ner.py
5) tsne.py can be used for generating projections using any method by changing a variable inside.
6) tsne.py outputs 4 images. It has to be run 4 times for these 4 images with different values of 'method' variable.
7) ner.py has two variables 'method' and 'update', which can be used to generate 6 different outputs for the task.
8) All the six files with output as prefix are the output files, which contain predictions for test data using different methods
